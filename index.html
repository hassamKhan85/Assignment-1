<p>French (alt. Turkish, Dark, Espresso) is the name applied to a degree of roast of coffee beans resulting in a dark brown coffee bean. In this roast, the beans are well into the second crack. French roasted beans will have a dark brown color and a shiney surface from its oils. Coffee brewed from French roasted beans will have the natural characteristic flavors of the bean muted, particularly any acidic notes. Bittersweet tones from the roast will dominate the flavor. French roast coffees are prevalent in coffee associated with the American West. </p>
