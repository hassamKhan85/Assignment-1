<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>The Grind is open in Westchase! We are excited to introduce our Coffee Shop & Cafe. If you crave great coffee, you’ll love knowing that we provide a real alternative to chains with handcrafted coffee and espresso drinks, a full tea bar, and real food options. 

    “We grind for you”… our local baristas know that great espresso takes more than pushing a button. We work hard to deliver great taste while also providing knowledgeable service, perfect if you just want to try something new.
    
    Our Cafe delivers way beyond the traditional coffee shop favorites (although we think our homemade pastries are pretty good). We have traditional breakfast choices, including eggs, omelettes, pancakes, and plenty of healthy options (including gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan).  Be sure to check out our weekend specials, when we go all out to provide you with new options that are delicious and different.   Finally,  we also serve a wide variety of salads,  sandwiches and flatbreads for lunch-lovers.
    
    And as a final quick intro to “us”- the owners: we are Westchase residents (no franchise or corporate owners in sight). Our first Grind, The Campus Grind, opened in 2010 at USF St Pete and provided us with real world experience to make sure The Grind at Westchase can actually deliver what we promise- a great restaurant and coffee shop experience.</p>
